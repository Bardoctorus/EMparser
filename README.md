# EM Parser - a workaround tool for a lazy content creator

This is the beginning stages of a tool designed to take notes I make for my weekly YouTube show and spit out text/html I can paste into YouTube, Libsyn and Mailchimp without having to click copy and paste hundreds of times.

It's a work in progress and honestly I can't think of any other use case for anyone else.
