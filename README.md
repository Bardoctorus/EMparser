# EM Parser - a workaround tool for a lazy content creator

This is a tool that probably noone would ever find useful except me.

Usage: python3 parser.py EPISODENUMBER YOUTUBELINK "Short introductory paragraph"

EPISODENUMBER: suprisingly, the episode number
YOUTUBELINK: just the id part of the link, so Z8mGY9m41C8 for example
"short intro" is exactly that "This week we look at a cat with a really large head"


It spits out text files designed to go in YouTube, Libsyn, and Mailchimp - the latter two as HTML to stop the madness of copying and pasting it all
